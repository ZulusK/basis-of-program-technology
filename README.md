### Technologies
* Java
* Maven
* ANTLRv4
* JBehave
* JUnit
### Lab1
- Create a class to work with matrices, which is a wrapper of two-dimensionalth array of real numbers.
- Describe in class the methods needed for in-data realization, data output, Equals, toString methods:
	1. Sum of 2 matrixes
	2. Multiplication of matrix and real number
	3. Triangularization of matrix
	4. Determinant of matrix
- With methods to organize validation of input data in terms of correction-performance of operations on matrices / vectors. 
- In case of incorrectness,generate an exclusive situation with the corresponding message
- Write modular tests to test the operations of constructors, methods of matrix
calculations and methods of Equals, toString
### Lab2
- Write a program in the programming language Java, which builds a finite automaton for recognition of a string given by a regular expression
- Describe the parametric modular tests and test the program on different sets of input data.   
__Regex__: \{(\d+|[A-Z]+)\}
### Lab2
1) write a syntactic analyzer for Java programming, a language that is valid
the commander and vice-president of the matrix, realizing at the lab 1 
2) Test the program, usign BDD testing (JBehave)
